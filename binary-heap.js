// Binary Heap - complete binary tree that stores data efficiently, allowing quick access
//               to the maximum or minimum element, depending on the type of heap
//
// Types of Binary Heap:
//
// 1.) Max Binary Heap - parent nodes are always larger than the child nodes but not guarantee between sibling nodes
// 2.) Min Binary Heap - parent nodes are always smaller than the child nodes, also not guarantee between sibling nodes
