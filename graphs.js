// Graphs - a graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of //unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graphs.
//        - nodes + collections

// Uses for Graphs: Social Networks
//                - Location/Mapping
//                - Routing Algorithms
//                - Visual Hierarchy
//                - File System Optimizations
