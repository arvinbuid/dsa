// Graphs - a graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points,
//          together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graphs
//        - nodes + collections

// Uses for Graphs: Social Networks
//                - Location/Mapping
//                - Routing Algorithms
//                - Visual Hierarchy
//                - File System Optimizations

// Graph Terms:
//
// 1.) Vertex - a node
// 2.) Edge - connection between nodes

//
// Types of Graphs:
//
// 1.) Undirected Graph - there is no direction or polarity to the connections of edges between the vertices
// 2.) Directed Graph - often represented with arrows which indicates the direction and polarity assign to an edge
// 3.) Weighted Graph - graph where each edge has a number (weight) that represents distance, cost, or time
// 4.) Unweighted Graph - opposite of weighted graph
