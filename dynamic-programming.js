// Dynamic Programming - a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

// Conditions:
//
// 1.) Overlapping Subproblems - a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times
//                         - ex. Fibonacci Sequence

// 2.) Optimal Substructure - a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
//                         - ex. Fibonacci Sequence, Shortest Path between vertices on a Graph
